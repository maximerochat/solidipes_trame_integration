# Trame integration in Solidipes
This repo is a work in progress of potential solution to the pyvista deprecation of other backend than Trame

## TODO 
- make more warp fit to the different warp method (warp might be a vector or even a matrix)
- show ifram spawn on jupyterlab
- default local rendering
- make a play animation button for multiframes
